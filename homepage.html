            Mwihoko conservancy's main aim, is working towards the concerted effort to protect and preserve the diverse array of species and ecosystems that constitute the natural world. We encompasses a range of strategies aimed at safeguarding wildlife habitats, combating threats such as habitat destruction, pollution, climate change, and poaching, and promoting sustainable coexistence between human communities and wildlife. Wildlife conservancies often involve the establishment of protected areas such as national parks, wildlife reserves, and marine sanctuaries, where wildlife can thrive undisturbed by human activities. Additionally, conservation initiatives may include community-based conservation programs that engage local communities in conservation efforts, as well as scientific research, advocacy, and education to raise awareness about the importance of wildlife conservation and inspire action. By preserving wildlife and their habitats, conservancies not only protect biodiversity but also ensure the continued provision of ecosystem services essential for human well-being.

                    Giraffes face threats from habitat loss, fragmentation, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. They are currently listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, with some subspecies facing a higher risk of extinction than others. Conservation efforts are underway with other conservancies to protect giraffe populations and their habitats.

                    Chimpanzees, scientifically known as Pan troglodytes, are one of the two species of great apes native to the African continent, the other being bonobos. They are highly intelligent primates and are considered one of our closest living relatives, sharing about 98% of their DNA with humans.
